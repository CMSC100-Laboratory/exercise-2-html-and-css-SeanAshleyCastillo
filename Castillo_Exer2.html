                    I am Sean Ashley F. Castillo, currently a BS Computer Science student at the University of the Philippines Los Ba√±os.
                    I aspire to be a software developer who someday will be able to run his own company and create a program that will be useful for the community.
                    Currently as a student, I have certain degrees of experience in different parts of the field of Computer Science.
                    These experiences include coding in C, Python, Java, and a little bit of assembly.
                    In my third year of college, tackling Artificial Intelligence (AI) excites me due to the belief that it will be greatly relevant in the future.

                Big Iron is a two-player real-time game that is skill-based, where the two players will try to shoot each other.
                There are several power-ups available in the game which will spawn while the round is ongoing.
                Additionally, there is a train that blocks bullets from the player and it moves back and forth from the edges of the screen.
                It is a first to five game where every time a player gets shot the other player gets a score.

                        I have studied different sorting and searching algorithms with the use of C and linked list. 
                        From these experiences I have a basic understanding on how to use data structures and use them in organizing data.

                        Python is the first programming language that I learned and programmed with. I have a fair amount of knowledge on how its syntax and built in 
                        functions work but I can only consider myself as someone who has a basic knowledge and understanding of it.

                        Java is what I and my partner used in the creation of Big Iron my first project. From that experience I have the basic knowledge and understanding 
                        of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
